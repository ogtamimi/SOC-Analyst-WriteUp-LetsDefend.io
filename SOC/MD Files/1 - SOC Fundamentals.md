## 2) SOC Types and Roles  

### What is a SOC?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized facility where the information security team continuously monitors and analyzes an organization's security posture.  

The primary purpose of a SOC team is to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents using a combination of **technology, people, and processes**.

---

### Types of SOC Models  

Depending on an organization's security needs and budget, several SOC models can be implemented:

![Image 1](../Assets/SOC_Fundamentals/1.png)

#### In-house SOC  
An internal SOC is built and managed by the organization itself.  
Organizations choosing this model must allocate sufficient budget and resources to maintain continuous operations.

#### Virtual SOC  
A Virtual SOC does not operate from a fixed location. Team members typically work remotely from different geographic locations.

#### Co-Managed SOC  
This model consists of internal SOC staff working alongside an external Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP).  
Strong coordination and communication are critical in this structure.

#### Command SOC  
A Command SOC oversees multiple smaller SOCs across a wide region.  
This model is commonly used by large telecommunications providers and defense agencies.

---

## People, Process, and Technology  

Building a successful SOC requires strong coordination between:

- **People**
- **Processes**
- **Technology**

These three pillars must work together effectively.

### People  
A strong SOC team requires highly trained professionals who understand security alerts and attack techniques.  
Since threats constantly evolve, team members must adapt quickly and conduct continuous research.

### Processes  
SOC processes should align with industry standards such as **NIST, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA**.  
Standardization ensures consistency and prevents critical steps from being overlooked.

### Technology  
SOC teams rely on multiple tools for detection, prevention, testing, and analysis.  
The most expensive or popular product is not always the best choice — solutions must align with the organization’s needs and budget.

---

## SOC Roles  

### SOC Analyst  
SOC Analysts are typically categorized into Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.  
They classify alerts, determine root causes, and recommend remediation steps.

### Incident Responder  
Responsible for responding to and managing security breaches.  
They perform initial assessments and coordinate containment efforts.

### Threat Hunter  
A cybersecurity professional who proactively searches for hidden threats and vulnerabilities.  
They investigate advanced persistent threats (APTs) and sophisticated attacks that may bypass traditional defenses.

### Security Engineer  
Responsible for maintaining and integrating security infrastructure such as SIEM and SOAR solutions.  
They ensure tools are properly configured and connected.

### SOC Manager  
Oversees budgeting, staffing, and strategic planning.  
Focuses on operational management rather than technical investigation.

## 3) SOC Analyst and Their Responsibilities  

A SOC Analyst is typically the first person to investigate system threats.  
If necessary, incidents are escalated to higher-level analysts or supervisors.

They play a critical role because they are the first line of defense.

---

### A Day in the Life of a SOC Analyst  

Throughout the day, a SOC analyst:

- Reviews SIEM alerts  
- Determines whether alerts are true positives or false positives  
- Uses tools like EDR, Log Management, and SOAR to investigate  

---

## Required Skills for a SOC Analyst  

### Operating Systems  
Understanding Windows and Linux systems is essential.  
You must know what is considered normal behavior before identifying suspicious activity.

### Networking  
SOC analysts frequently investigate malicious IPs and URLs.  
Understanding networking fundamentals helps detect data leaks and suspicious communications.

### Malware Analysis  
Analysts must understand malicious software behavior.  
They should identify command-and-control (C2) communications and determine the malware’s objective.

## 4) SIEM and Analyst Relationship  

### What is SIEM?

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a security solution that provides real-time logging and event analysis to detect threats.

Its core function is to collect, filter, and generate alerts for suspicious activities.

Example:  
If someone enters 20 incorrect passwords within 10 seconds, a SIEM rule may trigger an alert.

Popular SIEM solutions include:
- IBM QRadar  
- ArcSight ESM  
- FortiSIEM  
- Splunk

---

### Relationship Between SOC Analyst and SIEM  

SOC analysts primarily monitor and analyze alerts generated by SIEM.

Alerts appear in the **Main Channel**, and analysts can take ownership of alerts to begin investigation.

When closing an alert:

### When you close an alert, which channel can you access it from?
> **ANSWER: Closed Alerts**

## 5) Log Management  

### What is Log Management?

Log Management centralizes logs from multiple sources:
- Web logs  
- OS logs  
- Firewall logs  
- Proxy logs  
- EDR logs  

This improves efficiency and reduces errors.

---

### Practical Investigation Examples  

Searching logs helps determine:
- Whether devices communicated with a malicious IP
- Whether other endpoints are affected

---

### Questions  

What source IP address entered the URL `https://github.com/apache/flink/compare`?  
> **ANSWER: 172.16.17.54**

What is the type of log with destination port 52567 and source IP 8.8.8.8?  
> **ANSWER: DNSTop**

---

## 6) EDR – Endpoint Detection and Response  

EDR solutions monitor endpoint devices and provide detection and response capabilities.

Common EDR tools:
- Carbon Black  
- SentinelOne  
- FireEye HX  

![Image 6](../Assets/SOC_Fundamentals/6.png)

EDR provides:
- Process lists  
- Browser history  
- Network connections  
- Live investigation access

### Live Investigation  

You can remotely connect to a device for deeper analysis.

### Containment  

Compromised devices should be isolated to prevent lateral movement.

> **ANSWER: EricProd**

Complete CMD command executed on "Roberto" for `Ps1.hta`?  
> **ANSWER: C:/Windows/System32/mshta.exe C:/Users/roberto/Desktop/Ps1.hta**

## 7) SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

SOAR integrates security tools and automates workflows.

Common SOAR tools:
- Splunk Phantom  
- IBM Resilient  
- Logsign  
- Demisto
